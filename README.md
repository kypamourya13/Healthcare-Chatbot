# Title:
Enhancing a Health Care Chatbot with Deep Q-learning Algorithm and NLP: Insights from Conference and Journal Papers

# Objectives:
1. Explore the current state-of-the-art techniques and advancements in NLP and chatbot development through a review of relevant conference and journal papers.
2. Identify potential areas of improvement and optimization for the chatbot developed in the previous tutorials based on insights gained from the literature review.
3. Implement and test additional features and functionalities for the chatbot based on the insights gained from the literature review.
4. Evaluate the performance of the improved chatbot using test data and compare it with the performance of the original chatbot developed in the previous tutorials.
5. To understand the importance of contextual understanding in chatbots and how to implement it using techniques such as storing conversation history in a deque. (from paper 1)
6. To learn how to incorporate intent confidence scores to improve the accuracy of the chatbot and reduce the number of low-confidence matches. (from paper 2)
7. To understand the concept of fallback intents and their role in handling general queries or redirecting users to human agents when the chatbot is unable to match user inputs to existing intents. (from paper 3)
8. To learn how to improve the training of the DQN by implementing techniques such as early stopping to prevent overfitting and improve the chatbot's performance. (from paper 4)
9. To understand the benefits of adding more hidden layers to the DQN and how it can improve the chatbot's learning capacity, particularly in complex datasets or when new intents are added in the future. (From paper5)

# Level:
Our project's complexity is at a medium level as it involves engaging with humans and providing responses to their queries, to a certain extent, through a training model.
